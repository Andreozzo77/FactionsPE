###What is this?
This project is [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) plugin. This code allows your server to have factions gamemode.

####What is Factions?
Factions are any-sized groups of players who are on one team and work together to become the best. In each Faction, with the required mininum, you can protect land that becomes yours. But Factions is not just about Survival with PvP, it is warfare. Other Factions can easily find your Faction, and if they are reasonably stronger, they can blow you apart. I will teach you not only the simple commands, but also how to survive and become the top.
